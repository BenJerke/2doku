## 5/30/23
- Created Game, GridSquare, and Main classes
- Decided to set x and y coordinates in GridSquare, which would inform Game where the square was located
- Using Game to house all the logic for gameplay activities: printing the grid, updating squares, stuff like that.

- Figured out a crude way to set values in squares with user input
