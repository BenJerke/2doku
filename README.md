## A Harebrained Scheme by Ben Jerke and Maybe Some Friends

### BACKGROUND
My partner loves Sudoku puzzles. Last Christmas, she got a book of them as a gift. After she finished her spring semester, she finally had some time to take a look at it. However, there was a problem: The first few puzzles seemed to be invalid. Their starting values rendered the puzzle unsolvable. My partner is intimidatingly intelligent, and she's had a lot of practice with these things. I know she's right, and I want to prove it mathmatically. This sounds like a job for the computer. I want to write a program that can determine if a given Sudoku grid is valid, and maybe also allow the user to make their own Sudoku puzzles. 

### PROJECT GOALS
1. Develop an algorithm that, when given a Sudoku grid with user-defined starting values, can determine whether the grid is solvable. If the grid is solvable, display the solution. If the grid is not solvable, display a human-readable explanation of why. 
2. Develop an algorithm and user interface that allows the user to play Sudoku puzzles using pre-defined or randomly generated starting values. 
3. Allow the user to create Sudoku grids of scalable sizes. 
4. Allow the user to create Sudoku grids that aren't shaped like squares. 
5. Put the dang thing online.
